# Separar Strings

## Description
This small project takes one or more input strings separated by lines and transforms the strings into the following components:
- All the letters.
- The first four numbers in the string.
- The second four numbers in the string.
- Any remaining characters after the above extracted.
Finally, the program displays the processed string on the right side separated by tabs, making it easy to copy and paste the result.
